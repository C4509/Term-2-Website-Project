<h2>How To Play StarCraft</h2>
<p>When starting out, since the game itself does not have a guide on how to play, it may be a bit confusing.</p>
<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
<p>StarCraft is a resource-build type of game, so you should start by gathering as much resources as you can. You do this by selecting your workers, choosing "Build", and then sending them to either a mineral patch or a gas geyser by clicking on it. However, <u>do not</u> hoard your resources. Use them to build as many workers and structures as you can. You attack by selecting an army of workers, choosing "Attack", and clicking on a greyed out spot. However, when you first start, do not attack immediately or you will suffer an instant defeat. Instead, build and level up an army as big as you can, and also build a lot of army generating buildings. The army-generating buildings are different for every race- hatchery for Zerg, and gateway/barracks for Protoss and Terran.</p>
