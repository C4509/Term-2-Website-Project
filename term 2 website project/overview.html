<h2>Overview Of The Game</h2>
<p>StarCraft is a real-time strategy game. You play against other real players and build up your own military to wipe out your opponent's army and base. You can play as one of three races, Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. 
The Protoss can field powerful and expensive warriors and machinery, while the Zerg count on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm their opponents. The Terrans are the versatile and flexible alternative to both races, with an emphasis on specialization and combined arms.</p>
